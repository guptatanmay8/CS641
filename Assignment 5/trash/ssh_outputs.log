	You are in a passage. There is very little light here.
	You light a matchstick... the floor is full of rocks.
	A cold draught hits you from behind and you shiver. You try to
	walk quickly but stumble. Cursing your luck, you slow
	down. The passage curves downwards. You put one hand on a 
	side wall for guidance. The downward slope becomes steeper. 
	You walk very slowly to avoid falling down. The slope has 
	become very steep now... You throw away the matchstick to
	hold both side walls of the passage with your hands. It becomes
	completely dark! Your foot hits a small rock that rolls 
	down the passage. Stopping, you try to hear the sound of 
	the rock hitting the bottom and after a while you hear a 
	very distant splashing sound. The passage seems to be
	leading to some deep underground well! 

> go
[3;J[H[2J



	You bravely decide to go ahead. With slow and deliberate
	steps, you go down the slope. Suddenly, as you put down a
	foot on the floor, your foot finds thin air! In almost slow
	motion, you fall forward. You throw your hands about to hold
	a rock but miss everything and suddenly you are in a free 
	fall!! Desperate, you try to grab something, but there is 
	nothing to grab ...

	Magically, your fall downwards is arrested! Almost in slow
	motion, you go downwards till you hit water. It is very cold!
	You swim in one direction in the hope of finding dry land, but
	only find vertical rocky wall. Swimming in opposite direction
	yields the same result!

> dive
[3;J[H[2J



	Diving under the water, you immediately notice mild yellowish
	light coming out of what appears like a hole in a wall under the 
	water. Swimming quickly, you go through the hole. Now swimming 
	upwards, you quickly hit the surface, and find yourself in a
	kind-of pool. The pool is circular in shape. You swim to one end
	of it, and climb out of water...

	After a while, you look around the place. The pool is a perfect
	cicle! It cannot be naturally formed, you conclude. Then who could
	have constructed a pool in such a place? There are a number of
	lighted torches all around, providing ample yellow light. Someone 
	seems to have fitted these torches and lighted them! Another unanswered
	fact... 
	
	A well-lit passage is carved in the wall, and seems to be leading 
	somewhere deep inside...

> go
[3;J[H[2J



	You walk down the passage. After quite a long walk, the
	passage ends in a small door. Entering, you stand transfixed! 
	You are inside a large hall! Someone has constructed this deep
	inside the mountains!! The floor and the walls are made of marble, 
	there are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling with burning 
	torches inside. You rub your eyes in disbelief. But the scene stays.
	Recovering a little from the initial shock, you look around the hall. 
	It has two exits, one where you enetered from and the other that is
	closed. It has a glass panel next to it and it is a proper door, made 
	of carved wood...

	You go around the hall, exploring its details. The marble is is 
	very good quality. (How did someone get all this marble here, 
	you wonder?) It feels cold. The chandeliers are made of crystal glass, 
	so the light is reflecting in beautiful patterns. Who designed all this?

	You come up to the closed door and look at the screen ...
	... there is nothing written on it as earlier.

	As you wonder if the spirit is around to help you out, you hear
	it whispering in your ears ...

	"This is another magical screen. And this one I remember perfectly...
	
	Consider a block of size 8 bytes as 8 x 1 vector over F_{128} --
	constructed using the degree 7 irreducible polynomial x^7 + x + 1
	over F_2. Define two transformations: first a linear transformation 
	given by invertible 8 x 8 key matrix A with elements from F_{128} and 
	second an exponentiation given by 8 x 1 vector E whose elements are 
	numbers between 1 and 126. E is applied on a block by taking the ith 
	element of the block and raising it to the power given by ith element in E.

	Apply these transformations in the sequence EAEAE on the input block
	to obtain the output block. Both E and A are part of the key.

	You are in a passage. There is very little light here.
	You light a matchstick... the floor is full of rocks.
	A cold draught hits you from behind and you shiver. You try to
	walk quickly but stumble. Cursing your luck, you slow
	down. The passage curves downwards. You put one hand on a 
	side wall for guidance. The downward slope becomes steeper. 
	You walk very slowly to avoid falling down. The slope has 
	become very steep now... You throw away the matchstick to
	hold both side walls of the passage with your hands. It becomes
	completely dark! Your foot hits a small rock that rolls 
	down the passage. Stopping, you try to hear the sound of 
	the rock hitting the bottom and after a while you hear a 
	very distant splashing sound. The passage seems to be
	leading to some deep underground well!

	You bravely decide to go ahead. With slow and deliberate
	steps, you go down the slope. Suddenly, as you put down a
	foot on the floor, your foot finds thin air! In almost slow
	motion, you fall forward. You throw your hands about to hold
	a rock but miss everything and suddenly you are in a free 
	fall!! Desperate, you try to grab something, but there is 
	nothing to grab ...

	Magically, your fall downwards is arrested! Almost in slow
	motion, you go downwards till you hit water. It is very cold!
	You swim in one direction in the hope of finding dry land, but
	only find vertical rocky wall. Swimming in opposite direction
	yields the same result!

	Diving under the water, you immediately notice mild yellowish
	light coming out of what appears like a hole in a wall under the 
	water. Swimming quickly, you go through the hole. Now swimming 
	upwards, you quickly hit the surface, and find yourself in a
	kind-of pool. The pool is circular in shape. You swim to one end
	of it, and climb out of water...

	After a while, you look around the place. The pool is a perfect
	cicle! It cannot be naturally formed, you conclude. Then who could
	have constructed a pool in such a place? There are a number of
	lighted torches all around, providing ample yellow light. Someone 
	seems to have fitted these torches and lighted them! Another unanswered
	fact... 
	
	A well-lit passage is carved in the wall, and seems to be leading 
	somewhere deep inside...

> go
[3;J[H[2J



	You walk down the passage. After quite a long walk, the
	passage ends in a small door. Entering, you stand transfixed! 
	You are inside a large hall! Someone has constructed this deep
	inside the mountains!! The floor and the walls are made of marble, 
	there are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling with burning 
	torches inside. You rub your eyes in disbelief. But the scene stays.
	Recovering a little from the initial shock, you look around the hall. 
	It has two exits, one where you enetered from and the other that is
	closed. It has a glass panel next to it and it is a proper door, made 
	of carved wood...

	You go around the hall, exploring its details. The marble is is 
	very good quality. (How did someone get all this marble here, 
	you wonder?) It feels cold. The chandeliers are made of crystal glass, 
	so the light is reflecting in beautiful patterns. Who designed all this?

	You come up to the closed door and look at the screen ...
	... there is nothing written on it as earlier.

	As you wonder if the spirit is around to help you out, you hear
	it whispering in your ears ...

	"This is another magical screen. And this one I remember perfectly...
	
	Consider a block of size 8 bytes as 8 x 1 vector over F_{128} --
	constructed using the degree 7 irreducible polynomial x^7 + x + 1
	over F_2. Define two transformations: first a linear transformation 
	given by invertible 8 x 8 key matrix A with elements from F_{128} and 
	second an exponentiation given by 8 x 1 vector E whose elements are 
	numbers between 1 and 126. E is applied on a block by taking the ith 
	element of the block and raising it to the power given by ith element in E.

	Apply these transformations in the sequence EAEAE on the input block
	to obtain the output block. Both E and A are part of the key.

	You can see the coded password by simply whispering 'password' near 
	the screen..."
